## How to Use the Template
The template consists of the main `proposal.tex` file, a folder for the individual sections, and a folder for the images that you use.
It contains only very basic packages, so it should probably work with most Latex distributions and Overleaf.

In the `proposal.tex` file, you can set a few variables at the beginning of the file that then fill your cover page.

You can always find the newest version of this template in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hossainlab/research-proposal-template).
